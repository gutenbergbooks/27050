<p>Scripsimus ad te (charissime Gesnere) superioribus annis variam
historiam de variis quadrupedum, avium, atque piscium formis, variis
herbarum atque fruticum speciebus &amp; figuris. Scripsimus &amp; de
canibus quædam ad te seorsum, quæ in libro tuo de iconibus animalium
ordine secundo mansuetorum quadrupedum, ubi de Canibus Scoticis scribis,
&amp; in fine epistolæ tuæ ad Gulielmum Turnerum de libris a te editis,
inter libros nondum excusos, te editurum polliceris. Sed quia de Canibus
nostris quædam in eo libello mihi videbantur desiderari, editionem
prohibui, &amp; alium promisi. Quamobrem, ut promissis meis starem,
&amp; expectationi tuæ satisfacerem, homini omnis cognitionis cupido,
universitatem generis, differentiam atque usum, mores &amp; ingenium,
veluti

methodo quadam conabor explicare. Dispertiar in tres species, Generosam,
Rusticam, &amp; Degenerem; sic ut de illa primò, de hac postremò, de
rustica, medio loco tibi dicam. Omnes Britannicos vocabo; tum quòd una
Insula Britannia,
<span class = "pagenum rpt">4</span>
ut Anglicos omnes, sic quoque Scoticos omnes complectatur: tum quòd
venatibus magis indulgemus, quia voluptati ex feris &amp; venatione,
propter animalium copiam, atque hominum otium, magis Britanni sumus
dediti, quàm eorum animalium indigi &amp; negotiosi Scoti.
<span class = "sidenote">

Ex generosis venaticis.</a></span>
Ergo cum omnis ratio generosæ venationis, vel in persequendis feris, vel
in capiendis avibus finiatur, canum, quibus hæc aguntur, duo genera
sunt: alterum quod feras investiget, alterum quod aves persequatur.
Utraque Latinis uno &amp; communi nomine dici possunt venatica. Sed
Anglis cum aliud esse videatur feras sectari, aliud aves capere, ut
primum venationem, secundum aucupium nominant, ita canum nomina volunt
esse diversa: ut qui feras lacessunt, venatici; qui aves, aucupatorii
dicerentur. Venaticos rursum divido in quinque genera. Aut enim odoratu,
aut visu fatigant feras, aut pernicitate vincunt, aut odoratu &amp;
pernicitate superant, aut dolo capiunt.</p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
Sagax.</span>
Qui odoratu fatigat, &amp; prompta alacritate in venando utitur, &amp;
incredibili ad investigandum sagacitate narium valet: a&nbsp;qua re nos
sagacem hunc appellamus, quem Græci ab investigando ἰχνευτὴν,
à&nbsp;nare ῥινηλάτην dicunt. Huic labra propensa sunt, &amp; aures ad
os usque pendulæ, corporisque

media magnitudo.
<span class = "sidenote">
Leverarius.</span>
Hunc Leverarium vocitabimus, ut universum genus in certas species atque
nomina reducamus: cum alioqui usus aut officii nomine, in unitatem
speciei adigi nullo modo queant. Nam alius leporis, alius vulpis, alius
cervi, alius platycerotis, alius taxi, alius lutræ, alius mustelæ, alius
cuniculi (quem tamen non venamur nisi casse &amp; viverra) tantum odore
gaudet: &amp; in suo quisque genere &amp; desiderio egregius est. Sunt
ex his qui duos, ut vulpem atque leporem, variatis vicibus sequi
student, sed non ea felicitate, qua id quod natura sequi docuit: errant
enim sæpius.
<span class = "sidenote">
Terrarius.</span>
Sunt qui vulpem atque taxum solum, quos Terrarios vocamus; quod subeant
terræ cuniculos, more viverrarum in venatu cuniculorum, &amp; ita
terrent mordentque vulpem atque taxum, ut vel in terra morsu lacerent,
vel è specu in fugam aut casses cuniculorum ostiis inductas compellant.
Sed hi in sagacium genere minimi sunt.
<span class = "sidenote">
Sanguinarius.</span>
Qui insequuntur, majores: propenso &amp; hi labro atque aure, nec vivas
tantum uti memorati omnes, sed &amp;
<span class = "pagenum rpt">5</span>
mortuas quoque conspersi sanguinis odore persequuntur. Sive enim vivæ
sauciantur feræ, atque è manibus venatorum elabuntur, sive mortuæ ex
vivario sublatæ sunt (sed profusione sanguinis utræque) isti canes odore
facilè persentiscunt, &amp; subsequuntur. Eam ob causam ex argumento
sanguinarii appellantur. Cum tamen fieri solet ut furum astutia nullo
consperso sanguine abripiatur fera, etiam sicca hominis vestigia
<span class = "pagenum orig">2b</span>
<a name = "lat_page2b" id = "lat_page2b"> </a>
per extentissima spatia nullo errore sequi nôrunt, in quantalibet
multitudine secernere, per abditissima &amp; densissima loca appetere,
&amp; si flumina tranent etiam persequi, cumque ad ulteriorem ripam
perventum est, circuitu quodam qua fugitum est investigare, si primo
statim odore in vestigium furis non inciderint. Sic enim arte inveniunt,
quod fortuna nequeunt, ut rectè videatur ab Æliano scriptum lib.&nbsp;6.
cap. 59. de animalibus, τὸ ἐνθυμητικὸν καὶ διαλεκτικὸν, καὶ μέντοι καὶ
τὸ αἱρετὸν, hoc est, considerationem, ratiocinationem, atque etiam
participationem seu arbitrium canibus hisce venaticis inesse; nec ante
cessant persequi, quàm sunt fures comprehensi. Eos luce in tenebris
habent heri, nocte producunt, quo alacriores in persequendo sint assueti
tenebris, quibus prædones delectantur maximè. Iidem, cum fures
insequuntur, non ea donantur libertate qua cum feras, nisi in magna
celeritate fugientium furum, sed loro retenti herum ducunt qua velit
ille celeritate, sive pedes sit, sive eques. In confiniis Angliæ atque
Scotiæ propter frequentia pecorum &amp; jumentorum spolia, multus usus
hujus generis canum est, &amp; principio discit pecudem &amp; armentum
persequi, postea furem relicto armento. In hoc genere nullus est
aquaticus naturaliter, nisi eos ita nominare placeat, qui Lutram
insequuntur, qui subinde ripas, subinde aquas frequentant. Non recusant
tamen omnes, aviditate prædæ tranantis flumina, etiam aquis se
committere. Sed hoc desiderii potius est, quàm naturæ. Quod autem ex
<span class = "pagenum orig">3</span>

his aliquas Brachas nostri, Rachas Scoti sua lingua nominant, in causa
sexus est, non genus. Sic enim canes fœminas in venatico genere vocare
solent nostri. Ad postremum, in natura sagacium est, ut alii
pervestigando taceant ante excitatam feram, alii statim ad primum odorem
voce prodant animal, etsi remotum adhuc, &amp; in cubili; &amp; quo
juniores, eo
<span class = "pagenum rpt">6</span>
petulantioris oris &amp; mendacioris sunt. Ætas enim &amp; venandi
assiduitas experientiam in his facit &amp; certitudinem, ut in aliis
omnibus, maximè, cum norint obtemperare domino vel inhibenti vel
animanti.

Agasæus.</span>
Quod visu lacessit, nare nihil agit, sed oculo; oculo vulpem leporemque
persequitur, oculo seligit medio de grege feram, &amp; eam non nisi bene
saginatam &amp; opimam oculo insequitur, oculo perditam requirit, oculo,
si quando in gregem redeat, secernit, cæteris relictis omnibus,
secretamque cursu denuo fatigat ad mortem. Agasæum nostri abs re, quòd
intento sit in feram oculo, vocant. Usus ejus est, in septentrionalibus
Angliæ partibus magis quam meridionalibus; locis planis &amp;
campestribus, quàm dumosis &amp; sylvestribus; equitibus magis quàm
peditibus, quo ad cursum equos incitent (quibus delectantur magis quàm
ipsa præda) assuescantque sepes fossasque inoffensè &amp; intrepidè
transilire &amp; aufugere, quò insessores per necessitates &amp;
pericula salutem fuga sibi quærant, aut hostem insequendo cum velint
cædant. At si quando canis aberraverit, dato signo quàm mox accurrit,

leporarius dicitur, quòd præcipua ejus cura, præcipuusque usus est in
persequendo lepore. Quanquam &amp; in capiendo platycerote, cervo,
dorcade, vulpe, &amp; hoc genus aliis feris, &amp; viribus &amp;
memorata velocitate valent: sed plus minus pro suo quisque desiderio,
&amp; corporis firmitudine aut exilitate. Est enim strigosum genus: in
quo alii majores sunt, alii minores: alii pilo sessili, alii hirto.
Majores majoribus, minores minoribus feris destinamus. Cujus naturam in
venatione, magnam; in hoc, miram deprehendi: quòd (referente Joanne
Froisarto historico lib. hist. suæ&nbsp;4.) leporarius Richardi secundi

Henricum Lancastriæ ducem ad castellum Flinti ut Richardum

favoribus exceperit; quasi adversitates Richardi futuras intellexerat

circumacto corpore, impetu quodam in ipso specus ostio feram opprimit
&amp; intercipit. Is hoc utitur astu. Cum in vivarium cuniculorum venit,
eos non lacessit cursu, non latratu terret, nec ullas inimicitias
ostentat, sed velut amicus aliud agens, taciturna solertia
prætergreditur, observatis diligenter eorum cuniculis. Eò cum
pervenerit, ita se humi componit, ut &amp; adversum ventum semper
habeat, &amp; cuniculum lateat. Sic enim ille revertentis aut exeuntis

Hunde igitur (quem inter venaticos sagacem diximus) a&nbsp;verbo nostro

cum adhuc retinemus multa Germanica vocabula, a&nbsp;Saxonibus cum

Similiter à verbo nostrati, Gase, (quòd fixius rem aliquam &amp;

<span class = "pagenum rpt">17</span>
ante Agasæum nominari diximus. Neque enim odoratu, sed prospectu attento
&amp; diligenti feram persequitur iste canis, ut jam ante memoravimus;

A levitate Leviner, à loro Lyemmer, appellatur is quem Levinarium &amp;
Lorarium latinè nominavimus. Nam Lyemme nostra lingua, Lorum significat.
Quod autem a levitate Leviner, hoc est a latina voce Britannicam,
diducimus: cur in libris nostris sparsim a Græcis dictionibus &amp;
Latinis Italicis &amp; Germanicis, Gallicis &amp; Hispanicis nostratia

<span class = "sidenote">

Vertagus.</span>
Postremus inter venaticos Vertagus est, quem Tumbler vocitamus; quòd
tumble apud nos vertere est Latinis, &amp; tumbiere Gallis, unde ortum

quàm in lingua Gallica &amp; Italica, in quibus liquida ante vocalem,

Post hunc subsequitur aquaticus, hoc est a Waterspainel, a&nbsp;vocibus
Water &amp; Spaine (hoc est aqua &amp; Hispania) deducto nomine. Nam
aqua, in qua se exercet canis iste, Water; &amp; Hispania (unde primum
genus hoc tractum ex nomine creditur) Spaine apud nostros vocitatur. Non
quòd isti canes
<span class = "pagenum rpt">18</span>
non sint etiam nativi in Britannia, sed quòd generale &amp; commune
nomen canum, qui ex Hispania primò profecti putantur, istæ canum species
(ut &amp; cæteri Aucupatorii) adhuc vulgo referunt, etsi in Britannia
oriantur, &amp; peculiari aliqua vocis nota, aut qualitatis indicio
secernantur apud nos; ut est ista species vocis Water, hoc est aquæ,
appositione.
<span class = "sidenote">
Inquisitor.</span>
Alio etiam nomine a Finder canis iste appellatur, quòd quærendo invenit
res deperditas, quæ res nostris, fynde, hoc est invenire, dicitur. Nos
tamen ab inquirendo latinum nomen huic fecimus, quòd præcipua pars
inventionis in inquirendo est.</p>

<p>A venaticis &amp; aucupatoriis transitus est ad Delicatos, Rusticos,

<span class = "sidenote">
Delicati.</span>
Delicatum, Melitæum &amp; Spainel gentle, hoc est Hispaniolum generosum,
nominavimus, à&nbsp;generositatis nomine data appellatione, quòd inter
nobiles viros atque fœminas versari, &amp; iis in deliciis atque ad
lusus esse consuevit: ut erat illud Gorgonis κυνίδιον apud Theocritum in
Syracusiis, quod discedens servæ diligentiæ pari cura cum infante
commiserat, ut catellum quidem illa intro revocaret, puerum verò
vagientem placaret. Ad alia omnia
<span class = "pagenum orig">12b</span>

inutilis canis iste est, nisi ad ea quæ jam ante diximus, nisi ad
fovendum stomachum debilitatum frigore, nisi ad prodendum adulterium,
quod fecisse hujus generis catellum quendam Siculum refert Ælianus,
libro septimo, capite vicesimo quinto animalium.</p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
Rustici.</span>
Rusticos, Shepeherdes dogges, Mastives, &amp; Bandedogges nominavimus:
illorum quidem deducto nomine a pastore, qui Shepeherde apud nos
dicitur, quòd custodit oves, quæ nostris, Shepe, appellantur: istorum a
ligamento, quod Bande, &amp; Sagina, quod maste, villicis nostris
hominibus dicitur. Est enim crassum genus canum, &amp; bene saginatum
catenarium hoc. Etsi non sum nescius Augustinum Niphum, Mastinum
(mastivum nostri dicunt) pecuarium existimare: &amp; Albertum Lyciscum

Versator.</span>
Ad postremum, degeneres Wappe &amp; Turnespete nominari dicebamus: hunc

imitationem Italorum, quod veru dicitur;
<span class = "pagenum rpt">19</span>
illum a naturali canis voce Wau, quam in latratu edit admonendo. Unde,
originaliter Waupe dicendum fuit. Sed euphoniæ bonæque consonantiæ
gratia, vocali in consonantem mutata, Wappe a nostris vocitatur. Etsi
non me fugit Nonium, a&nbsp;voce naturali Bau, formare suum baubari, non

As euery manifest effect proceedeth frõ som certain cause, so the
penning of this present abridgement (gentle and courteous reader) issued
from a speciall occasion. For Conradus Gesnerus, a man whiles he liued,
of incomparable knowledge, and manyfold experience, being neuer
satisfied with the sweete sappe of vnderstanding, requested <i>Iohannes
Caius</i> a profound clarke and a rauennous deuourer of learning (to his
praise be it spoke though the language be somewhat homely) to write a
breuiary or short treatise of such dogges as were ingendred within the
borders of England: To the contentation of whose minde and the vtter
accomplishement of whose desire, <i>Caius</i> spared no study, (for the
acquaintance which was betweene them, as it was confirmed by
continuaunce, and established vpon vnfainednes, so was it sealed with
vertue and honesty) withdrew himself from no labour, repined at no
paines, forsooke no trauaile, refused no indeuour, finally pretermitted
no opportunity or circumstaunce which seemed pertinent and requisite to
the performance of this litle libell. In the whole discourse wherof, the
booke, to consider the substaunce, being but a pamphlet or skantling,
the argument not so fyne and affected, and yet the doctrine very
profitable and necessarye, he vseth such a smoothe and comely style, and
tyeth his inuention to such methodicall and orderly proceedings, as the
elegantnes and neatnesse of his Latine phrase, (being pure, perfect, and
vn mingled) maketh the matter which of it selfe is very base and
clubbishe, to appeare (shall I say tollerable) nay rather commendable
and effectuall. The sundry sortes of Englishe dogges he discouereth so
euidently, their natures he rippeth vp so apparantly, their manners he
openeth
<!-- png 05 -->
so manifestly, their qualities he declareth so skilfully, their
proportions he painteth out so perfectly, their colours he describeth so
artificially, and knytteth all these in such shortnesse and breuity,
that the mouth of th’aduersary must needes confesse &amp; giue sentence
that commendation ought to bee his rewarde, and praise his deserued
pension. An ignoraunt man woulde neuer have beene drawne into this
opinion, to thincke that there had bene in England such variety &amp;
choice of dogges, in all respectes (not onely for name but also for
qualitie) so diuerse and vnlike: But what cannot learning attaine? what
cannot the kay of knowledge open? what cannot the lampe of vnderstanding
lighten? what secretes cannot discretion detect? finally what cannot
experience comprehend? what huge heapes of histories hath
<i>Gesnerus</i> hourded vp in volumes of a large syze? Fishes in
floudes, Cattell on lande, Byrdes in the ayre, how hath he sifted them
by their naturall differences? how closely and in how narrow a compasse
hath he couched mighty and monstruous beasts, in bygnesse lyke
mountaines, the bookes themselues being lesser then Molehilles. The lyfe
of this man was not so great a restority of comfort, as his death was an
vlcer or wound of sorrow: the losse of whom <i>Caius</i> lamented, not
so much as he was his faithfull friende, as for that he was a famous
Philosopher, and yet the former reason (being, in very deede, vehement
and forceable) did stinge him with more griefe, then he peraduenture was
willing to disclose. And though death be counted terrible for the time,
and consequently vnhappy, yet <i>Caius</i> aduoucheth the death of
<i>Gesner</i> most blessed, luckie, and fortunate, as in his Booke
intituled <i>De libris proprijs</i> appeareth. But of these two Eagles
sufficient is spoken as I suppose, and yet litle enough in consideration
of their dignitie and worthines. Neurthelesse litle or mickle, something
or nothing, substaunce or shadow take all in good part, my meaning is by
a fewe wordes to wynne credit to this worke, not so much for mine owne
Englishe Translation as for the singuler commendation of them,
challenged of dutie and desart. Wherefore gentle Reader I commit them to
thy memorie, and their bookes to thy courteous censure. They
<!-- png 06 -->
were both learned men, and painefull practitioners in their professions,
so much the more therfore are their workes worthy estimation, I would it
were in me to aduaunce them as I wishe, the worst (and yet both, no
doubt, excellent) hath deserued a monument of immortality. Well there is
no more to be added but this, that as the translatiõ of this booke was
attempted, finished, and published of goodwill (not onely to minister
pleasure, as to affoord profit) so it is my desire and request that my
labour therin employed may be acceptable, as I hope it shalbe to men of
indifferent Judgement. As for such as shall snarr and snatch at the
Englishe abridgement, and teare the Translatour, being absent, with the
teeth of spightfull <ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘euuye’">enuye</ins>, I conclude in breuity there eloquence is but

this treatise.</h4>

<p>I wrote vnto you (well beloued friende <i>Gesner</i>) not many yeares
past, a manifolde historie, contayning the diuers formes and figures of
Beastes, Byrdes, and Fyshes, the sundry shapes of plantes, and the
fashions of Hearbes,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p>I wrote moreouer, vnto you seuerally, a certayne abridgement of
Dogges, which in your discourse vpon the fourmes of Beastes in the
seconde order of mylde and tameable Beastes, where you make mencion of
Scottishe Dogges, and in the wynding vp of your Letter written and
directed to Doctour <i>Turner</i>, comprehending a Catalogue or
rehersall of your bookes not yet extant, you promised to set forth in
print, and openly to publishe in the face of the worlde among such your
workes as are not yet come abroade to lyght and sight. But, because
certaine circumstaunces were wanting in my breuiary of Englishe Dogges
(as seemed vnto mee) I stayed the publication of the same, making
promise to sende another abroade, which myght be commytted to the
handes, the eyes, the eares, the mindes, and the iudgements of the
Readers. Wherefore that I myght perfourme that preciselye, which I

both sydes of their chappes, and by the indifferent and measurable
proportion of their making. This sort of Dogges we call

<p>As for the Conny, whom we haue lastly set downe, wee use not to hunt,
but rather to take it, somtime with the nette sometime with a ferret,
and thus euery seuerall sort is notable and excellent in his naturall
qualitie and appointed practise. Among these sundry sortes, there be
some which are apt to hunt two diuers beasts, as the Foxe otherwhiles,
and other whiles the Hare, but they hunt not with such towardnes and
good lucke after them, as they doe that whereunto nature hath formed and
framed them, not onely in externall composition &amp; making, but also
in inward faculties and conditions, for they swarue oftentimes, and doo
otherwise then they should.</p>


<h4>Of the Dogge called a Terrar, in Latine <i>Terrarius</i>.</h4>

<p>Another sorte there is which hunteth the Foxe and the Badger or Greye
onely, whom we call Terrars, because they (after the manner and custome
of ferrets in searching for Connyes) creepe into the grounde, and by
that meanes make afrayde, nyppe, and byte the Foxe and the Badger in
such
<span class = "pagenum orig">5</span>
<a name = "trans_page5" id = "trans_page5"> </a>
sort, that eyther they teare them in peeces with theyr teeth beyng in
the bosome of the earth, or else hayle and pull them perforce out of
their lurking angles, darke dongeons, and close caues, or at the least
through cõceaued feare, driue them out of their hollow harbours, in so
much that they are compelled to prepare speedy flight, and being
desirous of the next (albeit not the safest) refuge, are otherwise taken
and intrapped with snares and nettes layde ouer holes to the same
purpose. But these be the least in that kynde called <i>Sagax</i>.</p>


<h4>Of the Dogge called a Bloudhounde in Latine
<i>Sanguinarius</i>.</h4>

<p>The greater sort which serue to hunt, hauing lippes of a large syze,
&amp; eares of no small lenght, doo, not onely chase the beast whiles it
liueth, (as the other doo of whom mencion aboue is made) but beyng dead
also by any maner of casualtie,
<span class = "pagenum rpt">5</span>
make recourse to the place where it lyeth, hauing in this poynt an
assured and infallible guyde, namely, the sent and sauour of the bloud
sprinckled heere and there vpon the ground. For whether the beast beyng
wounded, doth notwithstanding enioye life, and escapeth the handes of
the huntesman, or whether the said beast beyng slayne is conuayed clenly
out of the parcke (so that there be some signification of bloud shed)
these Dogges with no lesse facilitie and easinesse, then auiditie and
greedinesse can disclose and bewray the same by smelling, applying to
their pursute, agilitie and nimblenesse, without tediousnesse, for which
consideration, of a singuler specialtie they deserued to bee called
<i>Sanguinarij</i> bloudhounds. And albeit peraduenture it may chaunce,
(As whether it chaunceth sealdome or sometime I am ignorant) that a
peece of fleshe be subtily stolne and cunningly conuayed away with such
prouisos and precaueats as thereby all apparaunce
<span class = "pagenum orig">6</span>
<a name = "trans_page6" id = "trans_page6"> </a>
of bloud is eyther preuented, excluded, or concealed, yet these kinde of
dogges by a certaine direction of an inwarde assured notyce and priuy
marcke, pursue the deede dooers, through long lanes, crooked reaches,
and weary wayes, without wandring awry out of the limites of the land
whereon these desperate purloyners prepared their speedy passage. Yea,
the natures of these Dogges is such, and so effectuall is their
foresight, that they cã bewray, seperate, and pycke them out from among
an infinite multitude and an innumerable company, creepe they neuer so
farre into the thickest thronge, they will finde him out
notwithstandying he lye hidden in wylde woods, in close and ouergrowen
groues, and lurcke in hollow holes apte to harbour such vngracious
guestes. Moreouer, although they should passe ouer the water, thinking
thereby to auoyde the pursute of the houndes, yet will not these Dogges
giue ouer their attempt, but presuming to swym through the streame,
perseuer in their pursute, and when they be arriued and gotten the
further bancke, they hunt vp and downe, to and fro runne they, from
place to place shift they, vntill they haue attained to that plot of
grounde where they passed ouer. And this is their practise, if perdie
they cãnot at y<sup>e</sup> first time smelling, finde out the way which
the deede
<span class = "pagenum rpt">6</span>
dooers tooke to escape. So at length get they that by arte, cunning, and
diligent indeuour, which by fortune and lucke they cannot otherwyse
ouercome. In so much as it seemeth worthely and wisely written by
Ælianus in his sixte Booke, and xxxix. Chapter. <span class = "greek"
title = "To enthumêtikon kai dialektikon">Τὸ ἐνθυμητικον καὶ
διαλεκτικὸν</span>. to bee as it were naturally instilled and powred
into these kinde of Dogges. For they wyll not pause or breath from their
pursute vntill such tyme as they bee apprehended and taken which
committed the facte. The owners of such houndes vse to keepe them in
close and darke channells in the day time, and let them lose at liberty
in the night season, to th’intent that they myght with more courage and
boldnesse practise to follow the fellon in the euening and solitarie
houres of darkenesse, when such yll disposed varlots are principally
purposed
<span class = "pagenum orig">7</span>
<a name = "trans_page7" id = "trans_page7"> </a>
to play theyr impudent pageants, &amp; imprudent pranckes. These houndes
(vpon whom this present portion of our treatise runneth) when they are
to follow such fellowes as we haue before rehersed, vse not that liberty
to raunge at wil, which they have otherwise when they are in game,
(except upon necessary occasion, wheron dependeth an urgent and
effectuall perswasion) when such purloyners make speedy way in flight,
but beyng restrained and drawne backe from running at randon with the
leasse, the ende whereof the owner holding in his hand is led, guyded,
and directed with such swiftnesse and slownesse (whether he go on foote,
or whether he ryde on horsebacke) as he himselfe in hart would wishe for
the more easie apprehension of these venturous varlots. In the borders
of England &amp; Scotland, (the often and accustomed stealing of cattell
so procuring) these kinde of Dogges are very much vsed and they are
taught and trayned up first of all to hunt cattell as well of the
smaller as of the greater grouth, and afterwardes (that qualitie
relinquished and lefte) they are learned to pursue such pestilent
persons as plant theyr pleasure in such practises of purloyning as we
have already declared. Of this kinde there is none that taketh the water
naturally, except it please you so to suppose of them whych follow the
Otter, whych sometimes haunte the lande, and sometime vseth the water.
And yet neuerthelesse all the kind of them
<span class = "pagenum rpt">7</span>
boyling and broyling with greedy desire of the pray which by swymming
passeth through ryuer and flood, plung amyds the water, and passe the
streame with their pawes. But this propertie proceedeth from an earnest
desire wherwith they be inflamed, rather then from any inclination
issuyng from the ordinance and appoyntment of nature. And albeit some of
this sort in English be called <i>Brache</i>, in Scottishe <i>Rache</i>,
the cause hereof resteth in the shee sex and not in the generall kinde.
For we English men call bytches, belonging to the
<span class = "pagenum orig">8</span>
<a name = "trans_page8" id = "trans_page8"> </a>
hunting kinde of Dogges, by the tearme aboue mencioned. To bee short it
is proper to the nature of houndes, some to keepe silence in hunting
untill such tyme as there is game offered. Othersome so soone as they
smell out the place where the beast lurcketh, to bewray it immediatly by
their importunate barcking, notwithstanding it be farre of many furlongs
cowchyng close in his cabbyn. And these Dogges the younger they be, the
more wantonly barcke they, and the more liberally, yet, oftimes without
necessitie, so that in them, by reason of theyr young yeares and want of
practise, small certaintie is to be reposed. For continuance of tyme,
and experience in game, ministreth to these houndes not onely cunning in
running, but also (as in the rest) an assured foresight what is to bee
done, principally, being acquainted with their masters watchwordes,
eyther in reuoking or imboldening them to serue the game.</p>


<h4>Of the Dogge called the Gasehounde, in Latine <i>Agaseus</i>.</h4>

<p>This kinde of Dogge which pursueth by the eye, preuayleth little, or
neuer a whit, by any benefite of the nose that is by smelling, but
excelleth in perspicuitie and sharpenesse of sight altogether, by the
vertue whereof, being singuler and notable, it hunteth the Foxe and the
Hare. Thys Dogge will choose and seperate any beast from among a great
flocke or hearde, and such a one will it take by election as is not
lancke, leane and hollow, but well spred, smoothe, full, fatte, and
round, it
<span class = "pagenum rpt">8</span>
followes by the direction of the eyesight, which in deede is cleere,
constant, and not uncertaine, if a beast be wounded and gone astray this
Dogge seeketh after it by the stedfastnes of the eye, if it chaunce
peraduenture to returne &amp; bee mingled with the residue of the
flocke, this Dogge spyeth it out by the vertue of his eye, leauing the
rest of the cattell vntouched, and after he hath set sure sight upõ it
he seperateth it from among the company and hauing so done neuer ceaseth
<span class = "pagenum orig">9</span>
<a name = "trans_page9" id = "trans_page9"> </a>
untill he haue wearyed the Beast to death. Our countrey men call this
dogge <i>Agasæum</i>. A gasehounde because the beames of his sight are
so stedfastly setled and vnmoueably fastened. These Dogges are much and
vsually occupyed in the Northern partes of England more then in the
Southern parts, &amp; in fealdy landes rather then in bushy and wooddy
places, horsemen vse them more then footemen to th’intent that they
might prouoke their horses to a swift galloppe (wherwith they are more
delighted then with the pray it selfe) and that they myght accustome
theyr horse to leape ouer hedges &amp; ditches, without stoppe or
stumble, without harme or hassard, without doubt or daunger, and so
escape with safegard of lyfe. And to the ende that the ryders themselues
when necessitie so constrained, and the feare of further mischiefe
inforced, myght saue themselues vndamnifyed, and preuent each perilous
tempest by preparing speedy flight, or else by swift pursute made vpon
theyr enimyes, myght both ouertake them, encounter with them, and make a
slaughter of them accordingly. But if it fortune so at any time that
this Dogge take a wrong way, the master making some vsuall signe and
familiar token, he returneth forthwith, and taketh the right and ready
trace, beginning his chase a fresh, &amp; with a cleare voyce, and a
swift foote followeth the game with as much courage and nimblenesse as
he did at the first.</p>


<h4>Of the Dogge called the Grehounde, in Latine <i>Leporarius</i>.</h4>

<p>There is another kinde of Dogge which for his incredible swiftnesse
is called <i>Leporarius</i> a Grehounde, because the
<span class = "pagenum rpt">9</span>
principall seruice of them dependeth and consisteth in starting and
hunting the hare, which Dogges likewyse are indued with no lesse
strength then lightnes in maintenance of the
<span class = "pagenum orig">10</span>
<a name = "trans_page10" id = "trans_page10"> </a>
game, in seruing the chase, in taking the Bucke, the Harte, the Dowe,
the Foxe, and other beastes of semblable kinde ordained for the game of
hunting. But more or lesse, each one according to the measure and
proportion of theyr desire, and as might and habilitie of theyr bodyes
will permit and suffer. For it is a spare and bare kinde of Dogge, (of
fleshe but not of bone) some are of a greater sorte, and some of a
lesser, some are smooth skynned, &amp; some are curled, the bigger
therefore are appoynted to hunt the bigger beasts, &amp; the smaller
serue to hunt the smaller accordingly. The nature of these dogges I
finde to be wonderful by y<sup>e</sup> testimoniall of histories. For,
as Iohn Froisart the Historyographer in his 4. <i>lib.</i> reporteth. A
Grehound of King Richard, the second y<sup>t</sup> wore the Crowne, and
bare the Scepter of the Realme of England, neuer knowing any man, beside
the kings person, whẽ <i>Henry Duke</i> of <i>Lancaster</i> came to the
castle of <i>Flinte</i> to take King <i>Richarde</i>. The Dogge
forsaking his former Lord &amp; master came to <i>Duke Henry</i>, fawned
upon him with such resemblaunces of goodwyll and conceaued affection, as
he fauoured King <i>Richarde</i> before: he followed the Duke, and
vtterly left the King. So that by these manifest circumstances a man
myght iudge this Dogge to haue bene lightened wyth the lampe of
foreknowledge &amp; vnderstãding, touchyng his olde masters miseryes to
come, and vnhappinesse nye at hand, which King <i>Richarde</i> himselfe
euidently perceaued, accounting this deede of his Dogge a Prophecy of
his ouerthrowe.</p>


<h4>Of the Dogge called the Leuiner, or Lyemmer in Latine
<i>Lorarius</i>.</h4>

<p>Another sort of dogges be there, in smelling singuler, and in
swiftnesse incomparable. This is (as it were) a myddle kinde betwixt the
Harier and the Grehounde, as well for his kinde, as for the frame of his
body. And it is called in latine <i>Leuinarius</i>, <i>a Leuitate</i>,
of lyghtnesse, and therefore may well
<span class = "pagenum rpt">10</span>
be called a lyghthounde, it is also called by this worde
<i>Lorarius</i>, <i>a Loro</i>, wherwith it is led. This Dogge for the
<span class = "pagenum orig">11</span>
<a name = "trans_page11" id = "trans_page11"> </a>
excellency of his conditions, namely smelling and swift running, doth
followe the game with more eagernes, and taketh the pray with a iolly
quicknes.</p>


<h4>Of the Dogge called a Tumbler, in Latine <i>Vertagus</i>.</h4>

<p>This sorte of Dogges, which compasseth all by craftes, fraudes,
subtelties and deceiptes, we Englishe men call Tumblers, because in
hunting they turne and tumble, winding their bodyes about in circle
wise, and then fearcely and violently venturing upõ the beast, doth
soddenly gripe it, at the very entrance and mouth of their receptacles,
or closets before they can recouer meanes, to saue and succour
themselues. This dogge vseth another craft and subteltie, namely, when
he runneth into a warren, or setteth a course about a connyburrough, he
huntes not after them, he frayes them not by barcking, he makes no
countenance or shadow of hatred against them, but dissembling
friendship, and pretending fauour, passeth by with silence and
quietnesse, marking and noting their holes diligently, wherin (I warrant
you) he will not be ouershot nor deceaued. When he commeth to the place
where Connyes be, of a certaintie, he cowcheth downe close with his
belly to the groũd, Prouided alwayes by his skill and polisie, that
y<sup>e</sup> winde bee neuer with him but against him in such an
enterprise. And that the Connyes spie him not where he lurcketh. By
which meanes he obtaineth the sent and sauour of the Connyes, carryed
towardes him with the wind &amp; the ayre, either going to their holes,
or cõming out, eyther passing this way, or running that way, and so
prouideth by his circumspection, that the selly simple Conny is debarred
quite from his hole (which is the hauen of their hope and the harbour of
their health) and fraudulently circumuented and taken, before they can
get the aduantage
<span class = "pagenum orig">12</span>
<a name = "trans_page12" id = "trans_page12"> </a>
of their hole. Thus hauing caught his pray he carryeth it speedily to
his Master, wayting his Dogges returne in some conuenient lurcking
corner. These Dogges are somewhat
<span class = "pagenum rpt">11</span>
lesser than the houndes, and they be lancker &amp; leaner, beside that
they be somwhat prick eared. A man that shall marke the forme and
fashion of their bodyes, may well call them mungrell Grehoundes if they
were somwhat bigger. But notwithstanding they counteruaile not the
Grehound in greatnes, yet will he take in one dayes space as many
Connyes as shall arise to as bigge a burthen, and as heauy a loade as a
horse can carry, for deceipt and guile is the instrument wherby he
maketh this spoyle, which pernicious properties supply the places of
more commendable qualities.</p>


<h4>Of the Dogge called the theeuishe Dogge in Latine
<i>Canis&nbsp;furax</i>.</h4>

<p>The like to that whom we have rehearsed, is the theeuishe Dogge,
which at the mandate and bydding of his master steereth and leereth
abroade in the night, hunting Connyes by the ayre, which is leuened with
their sauour and conueyed to the sense of smelling by the meanes of the
winde blowing towardes him. During all which space of his hunting he
will not barcke, least he shoulde bee preiudiciall to his owne
aduantage. And thus watcheth and snatcheth up in course as many Connyes
as his Master will suffer him, and beareth them to his Masters standing.
The farmers of the countrey and uplandishe dwellers, call this kinde of
Dogge a nyght curre, because he hunteth in the darke. But let thus much
seeme sufficient for Dogges which serue the game and disport of
hunting.</p>

<p>The common sort of people call them by one generall word, namely
Spaniells. As though these kinde of Dogges
<span class = "pagenum rpt">13</span>
came originally and first of all out of Spaine, The most part of their
skynnes are white, and if they be marcked with any spottes, they are
commonly red, and somewhat great therewithall, the heares not growing in
such thicknesse but that the mixture of them maye easely bee perceaued.
Othersome of them be reddishe and blackishe, but of that sorte there be
but a very few. There is also at this day among vs a newe kinde of dogge
brought out of Fraunce (for we Englishe men are maruailous greedy gaping
gluttons after nouelties, and couetous coruorauntes of things that be
seldom, rare, straunge, and hard to get.) And they bee speckled all ouer
with white and black, which mingled colours incline to a marble blewe,
which bewtifyeth their skinnes and affordeth a seemely show of
comlynesse. These are called French dogges as is aboue declared
already.</p>


<h4>The Dogge called the Setter, in Latine <i>Index</i>.</h4>

<p>Another sort of Dogges be there, seruiceable for fowling, making no
noise either with foote or with tounge, whiles they followe the game.
These attend diligently vpon theyr Master and frame their conditions to
such beckes, motions, and gestures, as it shall please him to exhibite
and make, either going forward, drawing backeward, inclining to the
right hand, or yealding toward the left, (In making mencion of fowles,
my meaning is of the Partridge &amp; the Quaile) when he hath founde the
byrde, he keepeth sure and fast silence, he stayeth his steppes and wil
proceede no further, and with a
<span class = "pagenum orig">16</span>
<a name = "trans_page16" id = "trans_page16"> </a>
close, couert, watching eye, layeth his belly to the grounde and so
creepeth forward like a worme. When he approcheth neere to the place
where the birde is, he layes him downe, and with a marcke of his pawes
betrayeth the place of the byrdes last abode, whereby it is supposed
that this kinde of dogge is called <i>Index</i>, Setter, being in deede
a name most consonant and agreable to his quality. The place being
knowne by the meanes of the dogge, the fowler immediatly
<span class = "pagenum rpt">14</span>
openeth and spreedeth his net, intending to take them, which being done
the dogge at the accustomed becke or vsuall signe of his Master ryseth
vp by and by, and draweth neerer to the fowle that by his presence they
might be the authors of their owne insnaring, and be ready intangled in
the prepared net, which conning and artificiall indeuour in a dogge
(being a creature domesticall or householde seruaunt brought vp at home
with offalls of the trencher &amp; fragments of victualls,) is not much
to be maruailed at, seing that a Hare (being a wilde and skippishe
beast) was seene in England to the astonishment of the beholders, in the
yeare of our Lorde God, 1564, not onely dauncing in measure, but playing
with his former feete vppon a tabberet, and obseruing iust number of
strokes (as a practicioner in that arte) besides that nipping &amp;
pinching a dogge with his teeth and clawes, &amp; cruelly thumping him
with y<sup>e</sup> force of his feete. This is no trumpery tale, nor
trifling toye (as I imagine) and therefore not vnworthy to bee reported,
for I recken it a requitall of my trauaile, not to drowne in the seas of
silence any speciall thing, wherin the prouidence and effectuall working
of nature is to be pondered.</p>


<h4>Of the Dogge called the water Spaniell, or finder, in Latine
<i>Aquaticus seu Inquisitor</i>.</h4>

<p>That kinde of Dogge whose seruice is required in fowling vpon the
water, partly through a naturall towardnesse, and partly by diligent
teaching, is indued with that property.
<span class = "pagenum orig">17</span>
<a name = "trans_page17" id = "trans_page17"> </a>
This sort is somewhat bigge, and of a measurable greatnesse, hauing
long, rough, and curled heare, not obtayned by extraordinary trades, but
giuen by natures appointment, yet neuerthelesse (friend <i>Gesner</i>) I
have described and set him out in this maner, namely powlde and netted
from the shoulders to the hindermost legges, and to the end of his
tayle, which I did for vse and customs cause, that beyng as it were made
somewhat bare and naked, by shearing of
<span class = "pagenum rpt">15</span>
such superfluitie of heare, they might atchiue the more lightnesse, and
swiftnesse, and be lesse hindered in swymming, so troublesome and
needelesse a burthen being shaken of. This kinde of dogge is properly
called, <i>Aquaticus</i>, a water spaniel because he frequenteth and
hath vsual recourse to the water where all his game &amp; exercise
lyeth, namely, waterfowles, which are taken by the helpe &amp; seruice
of them, in their kind. And principally duckes and drakes, wherupon he
is lykewise named a dogge for the ducke, because in that quallitie he is
excellent. With these dogges also we fetche out of the water such fowle
as be stounge to death by any venemous worme, we vse them also to bring
vs our boultes &amp; arrowes out of the water, (missing our marcke)
whereat we directed our leuell, which otherwise we should hardly
recouer, and oftentimes they restore to vs our shaftes which we thought
neuer to see, touche or handle againe, after they were lost, for which
circumstaunces they are called <i>Inquisitores</i>, searchers, and
finders. Although the ducke otherwhiles notably deceaueth both the dogge
and the master, by dyuing vnder the water, and also by naturall
subtilty, for if any man shall approche to the place where they builde,
breede, and syt, the hennes go out of their neastes, offering themselues
voluntarily to the hãds, as it were, of such as draw nie their neasts.
And a certaine weaknesse of their winges pretended, and infirmitie of
their feete dissembled, they go so slowely and so leasurely, that to a
mans thinking it were no masteryes to take them. By which deceiptfull
tricke they doe as it were
<span class = "pagenum orig">18</span>
<a name = "trans_page18" id = "trans_page18"> </a>
entyse and allure men to follow them, till they be drawne a long
distaunce from theyr neastes, which being compassed by their prouident
conning, or conning prouidence, they cut of all inconueniences which
might growe of their returne, by using many carefull and curious
caueates, least theyr often haunting bewray y<sup>e</sup> place where
the young ducklings be hatched. Great therfore is theyr desire, &amp;
earnest is theyr study to take heede, not only to theyr broode but also
to themselues. For when they haue an ynckling that they are espied they
hide themselues vnder turfes or sedges, wherwith they couer and shrowde
themselues so closely and so craftely,
<span class = "pagenum rpt">16</span>
that (notwithstanding the place where they lurcke be found and perfectly
perceaued) there they will harbour without harme, except the water
spaniell by quicke smelling discouer theyr deceiptes.</p>


<h4>Of the Dogge called the Fisher, in Latine <i>Canis
Piscator</i>.</h4>

<p>The Dogge called the fisher, wherof <i>Hector Boethus</i> writeth,
which seeketh for fishe by smelling among rockes &amp; stones, assuredly
I knowe none of that kinde in Englande, neither haue I receaued by
reporte that there is any suche, albeit I haue bene diligent &amp; busie
in demaunding the question as well of fishermen, as also of huntesmen in
that behalfe being carefull and earnest to learne and vnderstand of them
if any such were, except you holde opinion that the beauer or Otter is a
fishe (as many haue beleeued) &amp; according to their beliefe affirmed,
and as the birde <i>Pupine</i>, is thought to be a fishe and so
accounted. But that kinde of dogge which followeth the fishe to
apprehend and take it (if there bee any of that disposition and
property) whether they do this for the game of hunting, or for the heate
of hunger, as other Dogges do which rather then they wil be famished for
want of foode, couet the carckases of carrion and putrifyed fleshe. When
I am fully resolued and disburthened of this doubt I wil send you
certificate in writing. In the meane season I am not ignorant of that
both Ælianus, and Ælius, call the Beauer
<span class = "pagenum orig">19</span>
<a name = "trans_page19" id = "trans_page19"> </a>
<span class = "greek" title = "kuna potamion [misprinted as κὐναποτάμιον]">κύνα ποτάμιον</span> a water dogge, or a dogge fishe, I
know likewise thus much more, that the Beauer doth participate this
propertie with the dogge, namely, that when fishes be scarse they leaue
the water and raunge vp and downe the lande, making an insatiable
slaughter of young lambes vntil theyr paunches be replenished, and whẽ
they haue fed themselues full of fleshe, then returne they to the water,
from whence they came. But albeit so much be graunted that this Beauer
is a dogge, yet it is to be noted that we recken it not in the beadrowe
of Englishe dogges as we haue done the rest. The sea Calfe, in
<span class = "pagenum rpt">17</span>
like maner, which our country mẽ for breuitie sake call a Seele, other
more largely name a <i>Sea Vele</i>, maketh a spoyle of fishes betweene
rockes and banckes, but it is not accounted in the catalogue or nũber of
our Englishe dogges, notwithstanding we call it by the name of a Sea
dogge or a sea Calfe. And thus much for our dogges of the second sort
called in Latine <i>Aucupatorij</i>, seruing to take fowle either by
land or water.</p>

<i>abridgement</i>.</h3>

<p>Nowe followeth in due order and conuenient place our Englishe Dogges
of the thirde gentle kinde, what they are called to what vse they serue,
and what sort of people plant their pleasure in thẽ, which because they
neede no curious canuassing and nye syfting, wee meane to bee so much
the briefer.</p>

<h4>Of the delicate, neate, and pretty kind of dogges<br>
called the Spaniel gentle, or the comforter,<br>
in Latine <i>Melitæus<br>
or Fotor</i>.</h4>

<p>There is, besides those which wee haue already deliuered, another
sort of gentle dogges in this our Englishe soyle but exempted from the
order of the residue, the Dogges of this kinde doth <i>Callimachus</i>
call <i>Melitæos</i>, of the Iseland <i>Melita</i>, in the sea of
<i>Sicily</i>, (what at this day is named <i>Malta</i>, an Iseland in
deede, famous and renoumed, with couragious and puisaunt souldiours
valliauntly fighting vnder the banner of Christ their vnconquerable
captaine) where this kind of dogges had their principall beginning.</p>

<p>These dogges are litle, pretty, proper, and fyne, and sought for to
satisfie the delicatenesse of daintie dames, and wanton womens wills,
instrumentes of folly for them to play and dally withall, to tryfle away
the treasure of time, to withdraw their mindes from more commendable
exercises, and to content
<span class = "pagenum orig">21</span>
<a name = "trans_page21" id = "trans_page21"> </a>
their corrupted concupiscences with vaine disport (A&nbsp;selly shift to
shunne yrcksome ydlnesse.) These puppies the smaller they be, the more
pleasure they prouoke, as more
<span class = "pagenum rpt">19</span>
meete play fellowes for minsing mistrisses to beare in their bosoms, to
keepe company withal in their chambers, to succour with sleepe in bed,
and nourishe with meate at bourde, to lay in their lappes, and licke
their lippes as they ryde in their waggons, and good reason it should be
so, for coursnesse with fynenesse hath no fellowship, but featnesse with
neatenesse hath neighbourhood enough. That plausible prouerbe verified
vpon a Tyraunt, namely that he loued his sowe better then his sonne, may
well be applyed to these kinde of people who delight more in dogges that
are depriued of all possibility of reason, then they doe in children
that be capeable of wisedome and iudgement. But this abuse peraduenture
raigneth where there hath bene long lacke of issue, or else where
barrennes is the best blossome of bewty.</p>


<h4>The vertue which remaineth in the Spainell gentle otherwise called
the comforter.</h4>

<p>Notwithstanding many make much of those pretty puppies called
Spaniels gentle, yet if the question were demaunded what propertie in
them they spye, which shoulde make them so acceptable and precious in
their sight, I doubt their aunswere would be long a coyning. But seeing
it was our intent to trauaile in this treatise, so that y<sup>e</sup>
reader might reape some benefite by his reading, we will communicate
vnto you such coniectures as are grounded upon reason. And though some
suppose that such dogges are fyt for no seruice, I dare say, by their
leaues, they be in a wrong boxe. Among all other qualities therfore of
nature, which be knowne (for some conditions are couered with continuall
and thicke clouds, that the eye of our capacities can not pearse through
thẽ) we
<span class = "pagenum orig">22</span>
<a name = "trans_page22" id = "trans_page22"> </a>
find that these litle dogs are good to asswage the sicknesse of the
stomacke being oftentimes thervnto applyed as a plaster preseruatiue, or
borne in the bosom of the diseased and weake person, which effect is
performed by theyr moderate heate. Moreouer the disease and sicknesse
chaungeth his place and entreth (though it be not precisely marcked)
into
<span class = "pagenum rpt">20</span>
the dogge, which to be no vntruth, experience can testify, for these
kinde of dogges sometimes fall sicke, and sometime die, without any
harme outwardly inforced, which is an argument that the disease of the
gentleman, or gentle woman or owner whatsoeuer, entreth into the dogge
by the operation of heate intermingled and infected. And thus haue I
hetherto handled dogges of a gentle kinde whom I haue comprehended in a
triple diuisiõ. Now it remaineth that I annex in due order such dogges
as be of a more homely kinde.</p>

<p>The first kinde, namely the shepherds hounde is very necessarye and
profitable for the auoyding of harmes and inconueniences which may come
to men by the meanes of beastes. The second sort serue to succour
against the snares and attemptes of mischiefous men. Our shepherdes
dogge is not huge, vaste, and bigge, but of an indifferent stature and
growth, because it hath not to deale with the bloudthyrsty wolf,
sythence there be none in England, which happy and fortunate benefite is
to be ascribed to the puisaunt Prince <i>Edgar</i>, who to thintent
y<sup>t</sup> the whole countrey myght be euacuated and quite cleered
from wolfes, charged &amp; commaunded the welshemẽ (who were pestered
with these butcherly beastes aboue measure) to paye him yearely tribute
which was (note the wisedome of the King) three hundred Wolfes. Some
there be which write that <i>Ludwall</i> Prince of Wales paide yeerely
to King <i>Edgar</i> three hundred wolfes in the name of an exaction (as
we haue sayd before.) And that by the meanes hereof, within the compasse
and tearme of
<span class = "pagenum orig">24</span>
<a name = "trans_page24" id = "trans_page24"> </a>
foure yeares, none of those noysome, and pestilent Beastes were left in
the coastes of England and Wales. This <i>Edgar</i>
<span class = "pagenum rpt">22</span>
wore the Crowne royall, and bare the Scepter imperiall of this kingdome,
about the yeere of our Lorde, nyne hundred fifty, nyne. Synce which time
we reede that no Wolfe hath bene seene in England, bred within the
bounds and borders of this countrey, mary there have bene diuers brought
ouer from beyonde the seas, for greedynesse of gaine and to make money,
for gasing and gaping, staring, and standing to see them, being a
straunge beast, rare, and seldom seene in England. But to returne to our
shepherds dogge. This dogge either at the hearing of his masters voyce,
or at the wagging and whisteling in his fist, or at his shrill and horse
hissing bringeth the wandring weathers and straying sheepe, into the
selfe same place where his masters will and wishe is to haue thẽ, wherby
the shepherd reapeth this benefite, namely, that with litle labour and
no toyle or mouing of his feete he may rule and guide his flocke,
according to his owne desire, either to haue them go forward, or to
stand still, or to drawe backward, or to turne this way, or to take that
way. For it is not in Englande, as it is in <i>Fraunce</i>, as it is in
<i>Flaunders</i>, as it is in <i>Syria</i>, as it in <i>Tartaria</i>,
where the sheepe follow the shepherd, for heere in our country the
sheepherd followeth the sheepe. And somtimes the straying sheepe, when
no dogge runneth before them, nor goeth about &amp; beside them, gather
themselues together in a flocke, when they heere the sheepherd whistle
in his fist, for feare of the Dogge (as I imagine) remembring this (if
vnreasonable creatures may be reported to haue memory) that the Dogge
commonly runneth out at his masters warrant which is his whistle. This
haue we oftentimes diligently marcked in taking our journey from towne
to towne, when wee haue hard a sheepherd whistle we haue rayned in our
horse and stoode styll a space, to see the proofe and triall of this
matter. Furthermore with this dogge doth the sheepherd take sheepe for
y<sup>e</sup> slaughter, and to be
<span class = "pagenum orig">25</span>
<a name = "trans_page25" id = "trans_page25"> </a>
healed if they be sicke, no hurt or harme in the world done to the
simple creature.</p>


<span class = "pagenum rpt">23</span>
<h4>Of the mastiue or Bandogge called in Latine <i>Villaticus</i> or
<i>Cathenarius</i>.</h4>

<p>This kinde of Dogge called a mastyue or Bandogge is vaste, huge,
stubborne, ougly, and eager, of a heuy and burthenous body, and therfore
but of litle swiftnesse, terrible, and frightfull to beholde, and more
fearce and fell then any <i>Arcadian</i> curre (notwithstãding they are
sayd to <ins class = "mycorr" title = "printed as shown: error for ‘haue’">ha<i>n</i>e</ins> their generation of the violent Lyon.) They
are called <i>Villatici</i>, because they are appoynted to watche and
keepe farme places and coũtry cotages sequestred from commõ recourse,
and not abutting vpon other houses by reason of distaunce, when there is
any feare conceaued of theefes, robbers, spoylers, and night wanderers.
They are seruiceable against the Foxe and the Badger, to drive wilde and
tame swyne out of Medowes, pastures, glebelandes and places planted with
fruite, to bayte and take the bull by the eare, when occasion so
requireth. One dogge or two at the vttermost, sufficient for that
purpose be the bull neuer so monsterous, neuer so fearce, neuer so
furious, neuer so stearne, neuer so vntameable. For it is a kinde of
dogge capeable of courage, violent and valiaunt, striking could feare
into the harts of men, but standing in feare of no man, in so much that
no weapons will make him shrincke, nor abridge his boldnes. Our Englishe
men (to th’ intent that theyr dogges might be the more fell and fearce)
assist nature with arte, vse, and custome, for they teach theyr dogges
to baite the Beare, to baite the Bull and other such like cruell and
bloudy beastes (appointing an ouerseer of the game) without any collar
to defend theyr throtes, and oftentimes they traine them vp in fighting
and wrestling with a man hauing for the safegarde of his lyfe, eyther a
Pikestaffe, a
<span class = "pagenum orig">26</span>
<a name = "trans_page26" id = "trans_page26"> </a>
clubbe, or a sworde and by vsing them to such exercises as these, theyr
dogges become more sturdy and strong. The force which is in them
surmounteth all beleefe, the fast holde which they take with their teeth
exceedeth all credit, three of them against a Beare, fowre against a
Lyon are sufficient, both to try masteryes with them and vtterly to
ouermatch
<span class = "pagenum rpt">24</span>
them. Which thing <i>Henry</i> the seuenth of that name, King of England
(a Prince both politique &amp; warlike) perceauing on a certaine time
(as the report runneth) commaunded all such dogges (how many soeuer they
were in number) should be hanged, beyng deepely displeased, and
conceauing great disdaine, that an yll fauoured rascall curre should
with such violent villany, assault the valiaunt Lyon king of all
beastes. An example for all subiectes worthy remembraunce, to admonishe
them that it is no aduantage to them to rebell against y<sup>e</sup>
regiment of their ruler, but to keepe them within the limits of
Loyaltie. I reede an history aunswerable to this of the selfe same
<i>Henry</i>, who hauing a notable and an excellent fayre Falcon, it
fortuned that the kings Falconers, in the presence and hearing of his
grace, highly commended his Maiesties Falcon, saying that it feared not
to intermeddle with an Eagle, it was so venturous a byrde and so mighty,
which when the King harde, he charged that the Falcon should be killed
without delay, for the selfe same reason (as it may seeme) which was
rehersed in the cõclusion of the former history concerning the same
king. This dogge is called, in like maner, <i>Cathenarius</i>, <i>a
Cathena</i>, of the chaine wherwith he is tyed at the gates, in
y<sup>e</sup> day time, least beyng lose he should doe much mischiefe
and yet might giue occasion of feare and terror by his bigge barcking.
And albeit <i>Cicero</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagAe" id = "tagAe"
href = "#cicero">A</a> in his oration had <i>Pro. S. Ross.</i> be of
this opinion, that such Dogges as barcke in the broade day light shoulde
haue their legges broken, yet our countrymen, on this side the seas for
their carelessnes of lyfe setting all at cinque and sice, are of a
contrary iudgement. For theefes roge vp &amp; down in euery corner, no
place is free from them, no not y<sup>e</sup> princes pallace,
<span class = "pagenum orig">27</span>
<a name = "trans_page27" id = "trans_page27"> </a>
nor the country mans cotage. In the day time they practise pilfering,
picking, open robbing, and priuy stealing, and what legerdemaine lacke
they? not fearing the shamefull and horrible death of hanging. The cause
of which inconuenience doth not onely issue from nipping neede &amp;
wringing want, for all y<sup>t</sup> steale, are not pinched with
pouerty, but som steale to maintaine their excessiue and prodigall
expences in apparell, their lewdnes of lyfe, their hautines of hart,
theyr wantonnes
<span class = "pagenum rpt">25</span>
of maners, theyr wilfull ydlenes, their ambitious brauery, and the pryde
of the sawcy <i>Salacones’</i> <span class = "greek" title =
"megalorrhountôn [misprinted μεγαλὄρροῦντων]">μεγαλορρούντων</span>
vaine glorious and arrogant in behauiour, whose delight dependeth wholly
to mount nimbly on horsebacke, to make them leape lustely, spring and
praunce, galloppe and amble, to runne a race, to wynde in compasse, and
so forthe, liuing all together vpon the fatnesse of the spoyle. Othersom
therbe which steale, being thereto prouoked by penury &amp; neede, like
masterlesse mẽ applying themselues to no honest trade, but raunging vp
and downe impudently begging, and complayning of bodily weakenesse where
is no want of abilitie. But valiaunt <i>Valentine</i> th’emperour, by
holsome lawes prouided that suche as hauing no corporall sicknesse,
solde themselues to begging, pleded pouerty wyth pretended infirmitie,
&amp; cloaked their ydle and slouthfull life with colourable shifts and
cloudy cossening, should be a perpetuall slaue and drudge to him, by
whom their impudent ydlenes was bewrayed, and layde against them in
publique place, least the insufferable slouthfullnes of such vagabondes
should be burthenous to the people, or being so hatefull and odious,
should growe into an example. <i>Alfredus</i> likewise in the gouernment
of his common wealth, procured such increase of credite to Justice and
vpright dealing by his prudent actes and statutes, that if a mã
trauailing by the hygh way of the countrey vnder his dominion, chaunced
to lose a budget full of gold, or his capcase farsed with things of
great value, late in the euening, he should finde it where
<span class = "pagenum orig">28</span>
<a name = "trans_page28" id = "trans_page28"> </a>
he lost it, safe, sound, and vntouched the next morning, yea (which is a
wonder) at any time for a whole monethes space if he sought for it, as
<i>Ingulphus Croyladensis</i> in his History recordeth. But in this our
vnhappy age, in these (I&nbsp;say) our deuelishe dayes nothing can scape
the clawes of the spoyler, though it be kept neuer so sure within the
house, albe it the doores bee lockt and boulted round about. This dogge
in like maner of <ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘Grecians’"><i>Græcians</i></ins> is called <span class = "greek" title

<span class = "pagenum rpt">26</span>
<h4>Of the latinists <i>Canis <ins class = "authcorr" title = "corrected by author from ‘Cultos’">Custos</ins></i>, in Englishe the Dogge
keeper.</h4>

<p>Borrowing his name of his seruire, for he doth not onely keepe
farmers houses, but also merchaunts maisons, wherin great wealth,
riches, substaunce, and costly stuffe is reposed. And therfore were
certaine dogges founde and maintained at the common costes and charges
of the Citizens of <i>Rome</i> in the place called <i>Capitolium</i>, to
giue warning of theefes comming. This kind of dogge, is also called,</p>


<h4>In latine <i>Canis Laniarius</i> in Englishe the Butchers
Dogge.</h4>

<p>So called for the necessity of his vse, for his seruice affoordeth
great benefite to the Butcher as well in following as in taking his
cattell when neede constraineth, vrgeth, and requireth. This kinde of
dogge is likewise called,</p>


<h4>In latine <i>Molossicus</i> or <i>Molossus</i>.</h4>

<p>After the name of a countrey in <i>Epirus</i> called <i>Molossia</i>,
which harboureth many stoute, stronge, and sturdy Dogges of this sort,
for the dogges of that countrey are good in deede, or else their is no
trust to be had in the testimonie of writers. This dogge is also
called,</p>


<h4>In latine <i>Canis Mandatarius</i> a Dogge messinger or
Carrier.</h4>

<p>Upon substanciall consideration, because at his masters voyce and
commaundement, he carrieth letters from place to place, wrapped vp
cunningly in his lether collar, fastened therto, or sowed close therin,
who, least he should be hindered in his passage vseth these helpes very
skilfully, namely resistaunce
<span class = "pagenum orig">29</span>
<a name = "trans_page29" id = "trans_page29"> </a>
in fighting if he be not ouermatched, or else swiftnesse
<span class = "pagenum rpt">27</span>
&amp; readinesse in running away, if he be vnable to buckle with the
dogge that would faine haue a snatch at his skinne. This kinde of dogge
is likewise called,</p>


<h4>In latine <i>Canis Lunarius</i>, in Englishe the Mooner.</h4>

<p>Because he doth nothing else but watch and warde at an ynche, wasting
the wearisome night season without slombering or sleeping, bawing &amp;
wawing at the Moone (that I may vse the word of <i>Nonius</i>)
a&nbsp;qualitie in mine opinion straunge to consider. This kinde of
dogge is also called.</p>


<h4>In latine <i>Aquarius</i> in Englishe a water drawer.</h4>

<p>And these be of the greater and the waighter sort drawing water out
of wells and deepe pittes, by a wheele which they turne rounde about by
the mouing of their burthenous bodies. This kinde of dogge is called in
like maner.</p>


<h4><i>Canis Sarcinarius</i> in Latine, and may aptly be englished a
Tynckers Curre.</h4>

<p>Because with marueilous pacience they beare bigge budgettes fraught
with Tinckers tooles, and mettall meete to mend kettels, porrige pottes,
skellets, and chafers, and other such like trumpery requisite for their

otherwise he himselfe should carry vpon his shoulders, which condition
hath challenged vnto them the foresaid name. Besides the qualities which
we haue already recounted, this kind of dogges hath this principall
property ingrafted in them, that they loue their masters liberally, and
hate straungers despightfully, wherevpon it followeth that they are to
their masters, in traueiling a singuler safgard, defending them
forceably from the inuasion of villons and theefes, preseruing their
lyfes from losse, and their health from hassard, theyr

<p>If it chaunce that the master bee oppressed, either by a multitude,
or by the greater violence &amp; so be beaten downe that he lye
groueling on the grounde, (it is proued true by experience) that this
Dogge forsaketh not his master, no not when he is starcke deade: But
induring the force of famishment and the outragious tempestes of the
weather, most vigilantly watcheth and carefully keepeth the deade
carkasse many dayes, indeuouring, furthermore, to kil the murtherer of
his master, if he may get any aduantage. Or else by barcking, by
howling, by furious iarring, snarring, and such like meanes betrayeth
the malefactour as desirous to haue the death of his aforesayde Master
rigorouslye reuenged. <ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘And’">An</ins> example hereof fortuned within the compasse of my
memory. The Dogge of a certaine wayefaring man trauailing from the Citie
of London directly to the Towne of Kingstone (most famous and renowned
by reason of the triumphant coronation of eight seuerall Kings) passing
ouer a good portion of his iourney was assaulted and set vpon by
certaine confederate theefes laying in waight for the spoyle in
<i>Comeparcke</i>, a&nbsp;perillous bottom, compassed about wyth woddes
to well knowne for the manyfolde murders &amp; mischeefeous robberies
theyr committed. Into whose handes this passinger chaunced to fall, so
that his ill lucke cost him the price of his lyfe. And that Dogge whose
syer was Englishe (which <i>Blondus</i> registreth to haue bene within
the banckes of his remẽbrance) manifestly perceauyng that his Master was
murthered (this chaunced not farre from <i>Paris</i>) by the handes of
one which was a suiter to the same womã, whom he was a wooer vnto, dyd
both bewraye the bloudy butcher, and attempted to teare out the villons
throate if he had not sought meanes to auoyde the reuenging rage of the
Dogge. In fyers also which fortune in the silence
<span class = "pagenum rpt">29</span>

<a name = "trans_page31" id = "trans_page31"> </a>
and dead time of the night, or in stormy weather of the sayde season,
the older dogges barcke, ball, howle, and yell (yea notwithstandyng they
bee roughly rated) neyther will they stay their tounges till the
householde seruauntes, awake, ryse, searche, and see the burning of the
fyre, which beyng perceaued they vse voluntary silence, and cease from
yolping. This hath bene, and is founde true by tryall, in sundry partes
of England. There was no faynting faith in that Dogge, which when his
Master by a mischaunce in hunting stumbled and fell toppling downe a
deepe dytche beyng vnable to recouer of himselfe, the Dogge signifying
his masters mishappe, reskue came, and he was hayled up by a rope, whom
the Dogge seeyng almost drawne up to the edge of the dytche, cheerefully
saluted, leaping and skipping vpon his master as though he woulde haue
imbraced hym, beyng glad of his presence, whose longer absence he was
lothe to lacke. Some Dogges there be, which will not suffer fyery coales
to lye skattered about the hearthe, but with their pawes wil rake up the
burnyng coales, musying and studying fyrst with themselues how it myght
conueniently be done. And if so bee that the coales cast to great a
heate then will they buyry them in ashes and so remoue them forwarde to
a fyt place wyth theyr noses. Other Dogges bee there which exequute the
office of a Farmer in the nyghte tyme. For when his master goeth to
bedde to take his naturall sleepe, And when,</p>

<p>As Virgill vaunteth in his verses, Then if his master byddeth him go
abroade, he lingereth not, but raungeth ouer all his lands lying there
about, more diligently, I wys, then any farmer himselfe. And if he finde
anything their that is straunge and pertaining to other persons besides
his master,

whether it be man, woman, or beast, he driueth them out of the ground,

their natures,</p>

<p>The first are not greatly to be feared, because they themselues are
fearefull, and fearefull dogges (as the prouerbe importeth) barcke most
vehemently.</p>

<p>The second are daungerous, it is wisedome to take heede of them
because they sounde, as it were, an <i>Alarum</i> of an afterclappe, and
these dogges must not be ouer much moued or prouoked, for then they take
on outragiously as if they were madde, watching to set the print of
their teeth in the fleshe. And these kinde of dogges are fearce and
eager by nature.</p>

<p>The thirde are deadly, for they flye upon a man, without vtteraunce
of voyce, snatch at him, and catche him by the throate, and most cruelly
byte out colloppes of fleashe. Feare these kind of Curres, (if thou be
wise and circumspect about thine owne safetie) for they bee stoute and
stubberne dogges, and set vpon a man at a sodden vnwares. By these
signes and tokens, by these notes and argumentes our men discerne the
cowardly curre from the couragious dogge the bolde from the fearefull,
the butcherly from the gentle and tractable. Moreouer they coniecture
that a whelpe of an yll kinde is not worthe the keeping and that no
dogge can serue the sundry vses of men so aptly and so conueniently as
this sort of whom we haue so largely written already. For if any be
disposed to drawe the aboue named seruices into a table, what mã more
clearely, and with more vehemency of voyce giueth warning eyther of a
wastefull beast, or of a spoiling theefe then this? who by his barcking

more vigilant? what reuenger more constant? what messinger more speedie?
what water bearer more painefull? Finally what packhorse more patient?
And thus much concerning English Dogges, first of the gentle kinde,
secondly of the courser kinde. Nowe it remaineth that

The fifth Section of this</a><br>

<h4>Containing Curres of the mungrell and rascall sort and<br>
first of the Dogge called in Latine, <i>Admonitor</i>,<br>
and of vs in Englishe VVappe<br>
or VVarner.</h4>

<p>Of such dogges as keepe not their kinde, of such as are mingled out
of sundry sortes not imitating the conditions of some one certaine
spice, because they resẽble no notable shape, nor exercise any worthy
property of the true perfect and gentle kind, it is not necessarye that
I write any more of them, but to banishe them as vnprofitable
implements, out of the boundes of my Booke, vnprofitable I say for any
vse that is commendable, except to intertaine straũgers with their
barcking in the day time, giuyng warnyng to them of the house, that such
&amp; such be newly come, wherevpon we call them admonishing Dogges,
because in that point they performe theyr office.</p>


<h4>Of the Dogge called Turnespete in Latine <i>Veruuersator</i>.</h4>

<p>There is comprehended, vnder the curres of the coursest kinde, a
certaine dogge in kytchen seruice excellent. For whẽ any meate is to bee
roasted they go into a wheele which they turning rounde about with the
waight of their bodies, so
<span class = "pagenum orig">35</span>
<a name = "trans_page35" id = "trans_page35"> </a>
diligently looke to their businesse, that no drudge nor skullion can doe
the feate more cunningly. Whom the popular sort herevpon call
Turnespets, being the last of all those which wee haue first
mencioned.</p>


<span class = "pagenum rpt">33</span>
<h4>Of the Dogge called the Daunser, in Latine <i>Saltator</i> or
<i>Tympanista</i>.</h4>

<p>There be also dogges among vs of a mungrell kind which are taught and
exercised to daunce in measure at the musicall sounde of an instrument,
as, at the iust stroke of the drombe, at the sweete accent of the
Cyterne, &amp; tuned strings of the harmonious Harpe showing many pretty
trickes by the gesture of their bodies. As to stand bolte upright, to
lye flat vpon the grounde, to turne rounde as a ringe holding their
tailes in their teeth, to begge for theyr meate, and sundry such
properties, which they learne of theyr vagabundicall masters, whose
instrumentes they are to gather gaine, withall in Citie, Country, Towne,
and Village. As some which carry olde apes on their shoulders in
coloured iackets to moue men to laughter for a litle lucre.</p>

</table>

<p>Of the first we haue none naturally bred within the borders of
England. The reason is for the want of wolfes, without whom no such
kinde of Dogge can bee ingendred. Againe
<span class = "pagenum orig">36</span>
<a name = "trans_page36" id = "trans_page36"> </a>
it is deliuered vnto thee in this discourse, how and by what meanes, by
whose benefite, and within what circuite of tyme, this country was
cleerely discharged of rauenyng wolfes, and none at all left, no, not to
the least number, or the beginnyng of a number, which is an
<i>Vnari</i>.</p>

<p>Of the second sort we are not vtterly voyde of some, because this our
Englishe soyle is not free from foxes (for in deede we are not without a
multitude of them in so much as diuerse keepe, foster, and feede them in
their houses among
<span class = "pagenum rpt">34</span>
their houndes and dogges, eyther for some maladie of mind, or for some
sicknesse of body,) which peraduenture the savour of that subtill beast
would eyther mitigate or expell.</p>

<p>The thirde kinde which is bred of a Beare and a Bandogge we want not
heare in England, (A straunge &amp; wonderfull effect, that cruell
enimyes should enter into y<sup>e</sup> worke of copulation &amp; bring
forth so sauage a curre.) Undoubtedly it is euen so as we haue reported,
for the fyery heate of theyr fleshe, or rather the pricking thorne, or
most of all, the tyckling lust of lechery, beareth such swinge and sway
in them, that there is no contrairietie for the time, but of constraint
they must ioyne to ingender. And why should not this bee consonant to
truth? why shoulde not these beastes breede in this lande, as well as in
other forreigne nations? For wee reede that Tigers and dogges in
<i>Hircania</i>, that Lyons and Dogges in <i>Arcadia</i>, and that
wolfes and dogges in <i>Francia</i>, couple and procreate. In men and
women also lyghtened with the lantarne of reason (but vtterly voide of
vertue) that foolishe, frantique, and fleshely action, (yet naturally
sealed in vs) worketh so effectuously, y<sup>t</sup> many tymes it doth
reconcile enimyes, set foes at freendship, vnanimitie, &amp; atonement,
as <i>Moria</i> mencioneth. The <i>Vrcane</i> which is bred of a beare
and a dogge,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Is fearce, is fell, is stoute and stronge,</p>
<p>And byteth sore to fleshe and bone,</p>
<p>His furious force indureth longe</p>
<p>In rage he will be rul’de of none.</p>
</div>

<p>That I may vse the wordes of the Poet <i>Gratius</i>, This
<span class = "pagenum orig">37</span>
<a name = "trans_page37" id = "trans_page37"> </a>
dogge exceedeth all other in cruell conditions, his leering and fleering
lookes, his stearne and sauage vissage, maketh him in sight feareful and
terrible, he is violent in fighting, &amp; wheresoeuer he setteth his
tenterhooke teeth, he taketh such sure &amp; fast hold that a man may
sooner teare and rende him in sunder, then lose him and seperate his
chappes. He passeth not for the Wolfe, the Beare, the Lyon, nor the
Bull, and may wortherly (as I thinke) be companiõ with <i>Alexanders</i>
dogge which came out of <i>India</i>. But of these, thus much, and thus
farre may seeme sufficient.</p>


<span class = "pagenum rpt">35</span>
<h4>A starte to outlandishe Dogges in this conclusion, not impertinent
to the Authors purpose.</h4>

<p>Vse and custome hath intertained other dogges of an outlandishe
kinde, but a fewe and the same beyng of a pretty bygnesse, I meane
Iseland, dogges curled &amp; rough al ouer, which by reason of the
lenght of their heare make showe neither of face nor of body. And yet
these curres, forsoothe, because they are so straunge are greatly set
by, esteemed, taken vp, and made of many times in the roome of the
Spaniell gentle or comforter. The natures of men is so moued, nay rather
marryed to nouelties without all reason, wyt, iudgement or
perseueraunce. <span class = "greek" title = "Erômen allotriôn, parorômen sungeneis">Ἐρῶμεν ἀλλοτριῶν, παρορῶμεν συγγενεῖς</span>.</p>

artificers also. And why? it is to manyfest that wee disdayne and

briefer than the nature of the thing myght well beare) regardyng your
more earnest and necessary studdies. I will conclude makyng a rehearsall
notwithstanding (for memoryes sake) of certaine specialties contayned in
the whole body of this my breuiary. And because you participate
principall pleasure in the knowledge of the common and vsuall names of
Dogges (as I gather by the course of your letters) I suppose it not
amysse to deliuer vnto you a shorte table contayning as well the Latine
as the Englishe names, and to render a reason of euery particular
appellation, to th’intent that no scruple may remaine in this point, but

<p>The names contayned in the generall table, for so much as they
signifie nothing to you being a straunger, and ignoraunt of the Englishe
tounge, except they be interpreted: As we haue giuen a reason before of
y<sup>e</sup> latine words so meane we to doe no lesse of the Englishe
that euery thing maye be manyfest vnto your vnderstanding. Wherein I
intende to obserue the same order which I haue followed before.</p>


<h4>The names of such Dogges as be contained in the first section.</h4>

<p><i>Sagax</i>, in Englishe Hunde, is deriued of our English word
<span class = "pagenum orig">40</span>
<a name = "trans_page40" id = "trans_page40"> </a>
hunte. One letter chaunged in another, namely, T, into D, as Hunt,
Hunde, whom <ins class = "mycorr" title = "parenthesis in original">(if</ins> you coniecture to be so named of your country worde
<i>Hunde</i> which signifieth the generall name Dogge, because of the
similitude and likenesse of the wordes I will not stand in contradiction
(friende <i>Gesner</i>) for so much as we retaine among vs at this day
many Dutche wordes which the <i>Saxons</i> left at such time as they
occupyed this country of Britane. Thus much also vnderstand, that as in
your language <i>Hunde</i> is the common word, so in our naturall tounge
dogge is the vniuersall, but <i>Hunde</i> is perticuler and a speciall,
for it signifieth such a dogge onely as serueth to hunt, and therfore it
is called a hunde.</p>


<h4>Of the Gasehounde.</h4>

<p>The Gasehounde called in latine <i>Agasæus</i>, hath his name of the
sharpenesse and stedfastnesse of his eyesight. By which vertue he
compasseth that which otherwise he cannot by
<span class = "pagenum rpt">38</span>
smelling attaine. As we haue made former relation, for to gase is
earnestly to viewe and beholde, from whence floweth the deriuation of
this dogges name.</p>


<h4>Of the Grehounde.</h4>

<p>The Grehounde called <i>Leporarius</i>, hath his name of this word,
Gre, which word soundeth, <i>Gradus</i> in latine, in Englishe degree.
Because among all dogges these are the most principall, occupying the
chiefest place, and being simply and absolutely the best of the gentle
kinde of houndes.</p>


<h4>Of the <ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘Leuyuer’">Leuyner</ins> or the Lyemmer.</h4>

<p>This dogge is called a Leuyner, for his lyghtnesse, which in latine
soundeth <i>Leuitas</i>, Or a Lyemmer which worde is borrowed of Lyemme,
which the latinists name <i>Lorum</i>: and wherefore we call him a
Leuyner of this worde <i>Leuitas</i>? (as we doe many things besides)
why we deriue and drawe a thousand of our tearmes, out of the
<i>Greeke</i>, the <i>Latine</i>, the <i>Italian</i>, the <i>Dutch</i>,
the <i>French</i>, and the <i>Spanishe</i> tounge? (Out of which
fountaines in deede, they had their originall issue.) How many words are
buryed in the graue of forgetfulnes? growne out of vse? wrested awrye?

vocum Britannicarum</i>.</p>


<h4>Of the Tumbler.</h4>

<p>Among houndes the Tumbler called in latine <i>Vertagus</i>, is the
last, which commeth of this worde Tumbler flowyng first of al out of the
French fountaine. For as we say Tumble so they, <i>Tumbier</i>,
reseruing one sense and signification, which the latinists comprehende
vnder this worde <i>Vertere</i>, So that we see thus much, that Tumbler
commeth of <i>Tumbier</i>, the vowell, I, chaunged into the
<i>Liquid</i>, L, after y<sup>e</sup> maner of our speache. Contrary to
the French and the Italian tounge. In which two languages, A
<i>Liquid</i> before a <i>Vowell</i> for the most part is
<span class = "pagenum rpt">39</span>
turned into another <i>Vowell</i>, As, may be perceaued in the example
of these two wordes, <i>Implere</i> &amp; <i>plano</i>, for
<i>Impiere</i> &amp; <i>piano</i>, L, before, E, chaunged into, I, and
L, before A, turned into I, also. This I thought conuenient for a
taste.</p>


<h4>The names of such Dogges as be contained in the second Section.</h4>

<p>After such as serue for hunting orderly doe follow such as serue for
hawking and fowling, Among which the principall and chiefest is the
Spaniell, called in Latine <i>Hispaniolus</i>, borrowing his name of
<i>Hispania</i> Spaine, wherein wee Englishe men not pronouncing the
Aspiration H, Nor the <i>Vowell</i> I, for quicknesse and redinesse of
speach say roundly A Spaniell.</p>


<h4>Of the Setter.</h4>

<p>The second sort of this second diuision and second section, is called
a Setter, in latine <i>Index</i>, Of the worde Set which signifieth in
Englishe that which the Latinistes meane by this word <i>Locum
designare</i>, y<sup>e</sup> reason is rehersed before more largely, it
shall not neede to make a new repetition.</p>

<h4>Of the water Spaniell or Finder.</h4>

<p>The water Spaniell consequently followeth, called in Latine
Aquaticus, in English a waterspaniell, which name is compounde of two
simple wordes, namely Water, which in Latine soũdeth <i>Aqua</i>,
wherein he swymmeth. And <i>Spaine</i>, <i>Hispania</i>, the country frõ
whence they came, Not that England wanted such kinde of Dogges, (for
they are naturally bred and ingendred in this country.) But because they
beare the generall and common name of these Dogges synce the time they
were first brought ouer out of Spaine. And wee make a certaine
difference in this sort of Dogges, eyther for some thing which in theyr
voyce is to be marked, or for some thing which in their qualities is to
be considered, as for an example in this kinde called the Spaniell by
the apposition and putting to of this word water, which two coupled
together sounde
<span class = "pagenum rpt">40</span>
waterspaniell. He is also called a fynder, in Latine <i>Inquisitor</i>,
because that by serious and secure seeking, he findeth such things as be
lost, which word <i>Finde</i> in English is that which the Latines meane
by this Verbe <i>Inuenire</i>. This dogge hath this name of his property
because the principall point of his seruice consisteth in the
premisses.</p>


<h4>The names of such Dogges as be contained in the thirde Section.</h4>

<p>Now leauing the suruie we of hunting and hauking dogs, it remaineth
that we runne ouer the residue, whereof some be called, fine dogs, some
course, other some mungrels or rascalls. The first is the Spaniell
gentle called <i>Canis Melitæus</i>, because it is a kinde of dogge
accepted among gentles, Nobles, Lordes, Ladies, &amp;c. who make much of
them vouchsafeing to admit them so farre into their company that they
will not onely lull them in theyr lappes, but kysse them with their
lippes, and make them theyr prettie playfellowes. Such a one was
<i>Gorgons</i> litle puppie mencioned by <i>Theocritus</i> in
<i>Siracusis</i>,
<span class = "pagenum orig">43</span>
<a name = "trans_page43" id = "trans_page43"> </a>
who taking his iourney, straightly charged &amp; commaunded his mayde to
see to his Dogge as charely and warely as to his childe: To call him in
alwayes that he wandred not abroade, as well as to rock the babe a
sleepe, crying in the cradle. This puppitly and peasantly curre, (which
some frumpingly tearme fysteing hounds) serue in a maner to no good vse
except, (As we haue made former relation) to succour and strengthen
quailing and quammning stomackes to bewray bawdery, and filthy
abhominable leudnesse (which a litle dogge of this kinde did in
<i>Sicilia</i>) As <i>Ælianus</i> in <ins class = "mycorr" title = "text has ‘his. 7.’">his .7.</ins> booke of beastes and .27. chapter
recordeth.</p>


<h4>The names of such dogges as be contained in the fourth Section.</h4>

<p>Of dogges vnder the courser kinde, wee will deale first with the
shepherds dogge, whom we call the Bandogge, the Tydogge, or the Mastyue,
the first name is imputed to him
<span class = "pagenum rpt">41</span>
for seruice <i>Quoniam pastori famulatur</i>, because he is at the
shepherds his masters commaundement. The seconde a <i>Ligamento</i> of
the band or chaine wherewith he is tyed, The thirde a <i>Sagina</i>, Of
the fatnesse of his body.</p>

<p>For this kinde of dogge which is vsually tyed, is myghty, grosse, and
fat fed. I know this that <i>Augustinus Niphus</i>, calleth this
<i>Mastinus</i> (which we call Mastiuus.) And that <i>Albertus</i>
writeth how the <i>Lyciscus</i> is ingendred by a beare and a wolfe.
Notwithstanding the self same Author taketh it for the most part <i>pro
Molosso</i>. A dogge of such a countrey.</p>


<h4>The names of such dogges as be contained in the fifte Section.</h4>

<p>Of mungrels and rascalls somwhat is to be spoken. And among these, of
y<sup>e</sup> <i>VVappe</i> or <i>Turnespet</i>, which name is made of
two simple words, that is, of <i>Turne</i>, which in latine soundeth
<i>Vertere</i>, and of <i>spete</i> which is <i>Veru</i>, or
<i>spede</i>, for the Englishe word inclineth closer to the Italian
imitation: <i>Veruuersator</i>, Turnspet. He is called also VVaupe, of
the naturall noise of
<span class = "pagenum orig">44</span>
<a name = "trans_page44" id = "trans_page44"> </a>
his voyce <i>VV</i>au, which he maketh in barcking. But for the better
and the redyer sounde, the vowell, u, is chaunged into the cõsonant, p,
so y<sup>t</sup> for waupe we say wappe. And yet I wot well that
<i>Nonius</i> boroweth his <i>Baubari</i> of the natural voyce
<i>Bau</i>, as the <i>Græcians</i> doe their <span class = "greek" title
= "bauzein">βάυζειν</span> of wau<ins class = "mycorr" title = ", for .">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>Now when you vnderstand this that <i>Saltare</i> in latine signifieth
<i>Dansare</i> in Englishe. And that our dogge therevpon is called a
daunser and in the latine <i>Saltator</i>, you are so farre taught as
you were desirous to learne, And now suppose I, there remaineth nothing,
but that your request is fully accomplished.</p>


<h4>The winding vp of this worke, called the
Supplement,&nbsp;&amp;c.</h4>

<p>Thus (Friend <i>Gesner</i>) you haue, not only the kindes of our
countrey dogges, but their names also, as well in latine as in
<span class = "pagenum rpt">42</span>
Englishe, their offices, seruices, diuersities, natures, &amp;
properties, that you can demaunde no more of me in this matter. And
albeit I haue not satisfied your minde peraduẽture (who suspectest al
speede in the performaunce of your requeste employed, to be meere
delayes) because I stayde the setting fourth of that vnperfect pamphlet
which, fiue yeares ago, I sent to you as a priuate friende for your owne
reeding, and not to be printed, and so made common, yet I hope (hauing
like the beare lickt ouer my younge) I haue waded in this worke to your
contentation, which delay hath made somewhat better and <span class =

<p class = "inset">
In this volume no attempt has been made to produce a facsimile reprint.
Even if such a design had been entertained, the great variety of form in
which the original editions were issued would have made it impossible to
carry out the re-issue with any uniformity. Obvious misprints have been
corrected, but where a difference in spelling in the same work or on the
same page&mdash;<i>e.g. baccalarius</i>, <i>baccalaureus</i>&mdash;is
clearly due to the varying practice of the writer and not to the
printer, the words have been left as they stood in the original. On the
other hand the accents in the very numerous Greek quotations have been
corrected.</p>

<p>In <i>All the Year Round</i> for September 5, 1885, Charles Dickens
(son of the author) or an unnamed contributor wrote:</p>

<p class = "inset">
Dr. Caius ... had his scholar’s errors, else he would not talk of
lobster-hound, and of the urcanus (dogbear), “bred of a bear and
a bandog.”</p>

<p>The wolf-dog (<i>lyciscus</i>) and bear-dog (<i>urcanus</i>) each
requires no comment. The fox-dog (<i>lacæna</i>) is genetically
impossible.</p>

<p>Under <i>Leverarius</i> (Harier), the Latin original names eight
animals hunted by dogs:</p>

<p class = "inset">
Nam alius leporis, alius vulpis, alius cervi, alius platycerotis,
alius taxi, alius lutræ, alius mustelæ, alius cuniculi ...</p>

<p>The English translation expands these to eleven:</p>

<p class = "inset">
Some for / The Hare [<i>lepus</i>] / The Foxe [<i>vulpes</i>] / The
Wolfe / The Harte / The Bucke / The Badger [<i>taxus</i>] / The Otter
[<i>lutra</i>] / The Polcat / The Lobster / The Weasell / The Conny
[<i>cuniculus</i>], &amp;c.</p>

<p>The addition of Wolfe&mdash;an animal said not to exist in
England&mdash;is not explained. The Harte (<i>cervus</i>) is the elk or
red deer; the Bucke (<i>platyceros</i>) is the roe deer. The Lobster is
not a crustacean but a regional term for “polecat”, listed in the OED
with citations of appropriate date. The three-way distinction between
Polcat, Lobster and Weasell (subsumed under the single Latin word
<i>mustela</i>) is not explained.</p>
